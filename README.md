# Council of 1000: Comprehensive Introduction

Welcome to the central hub for **Council of 1000**—a game-changing, blockchain-powered PVP NFT card-collecting video game and the core of the **1000 Project** ecosystem. Whether you found us through X, Telegram, or directly, this guide will bring you up to speed on all our recent progress and what’s ahead. Stay tuned, as this file will be continuously updated to reflect project milestones.

## Project Overview

The **Council of 1000** is a turn-based strategy game where players collect NFT card packs, battle in immersive environments, and participate in tournaments to win real prizes. At its heart, the game leverages blockchain technology to deliver digital ownership, revenue-sharing, and community-driven development—all tied to the **1000 token**, our native cryptocurrency.

We’re merging cutting-edge visuals with deep strategy and economic incentives, creating a digital collectible game built for gamers and investors alike.

## Key Features and Mechanics

### NFT Card Packs

- **Serialized for Authenticity:** Every card is digitally serialized, ensuring that players own unique, verifiable assets.
- **Dynamic Rarity and Value:** Players can collect cards of varying rarity, each affecting gameplay and strategic options.
- **Revenue Sharing:** A portion of every card pack sale (5% or more) is allocated as **Council Tax**, providing ongoing dividends to **Council of 1000 NFT holders**.

### Dual Gaming Modes

- **Classic Mode:** Pure strategic gameplay using a standard deck of cards, perfect for purist players.
- **Advanced Mode:** Unlock customizations through **card leveling**, strategic upgrades, and **Build Your Own Card (BYOC)** options, where players can allocate attribute points and build 1 to 5 cards using a preallocated number of points.

### Card Leveling & Customization

- **Progressive Evolution:** Players can level up their cards by earning experience points (XP) in battles.
- **Personalized Decks:** Customize your cards to suit your playstyle and gain a competitive edge in PVP battles.

### Scene Visualizations & PvP Battles

We are currently evaluating Unity and Unreal Engine 5 to build a visually stunning experience. Players will battle in immersive environments with cinematic effects, random kill animations, and dynamic modifiers to make every match unpredictable and engaging.

## AI Telegram Bot Integration

We are designing a proprietary **AI-powered Telegram bot** that will provide:

- Real-time updates on gameplay, tournaments, and community events.
- Support for new players as they learn to navigate the game and ecosystem.
- Integration with website feeds to showcase real-time community contributions.

**Note:** Tournament signups and payments are managed directly within the **dApp**, ensuring secure transactions using the **1000 token**.

A portion (5%) of all tournament and game-related fees will be used for **buyback and burn**, reducing token supply and enhancing long-term value.

## 1000 Token: The Core of the Ecosystem

The **1000 token** is the native currency of the Council of 1000 game and its ecosystem. Players will use it for:

- **Tournament registrations and in-game fees**
- **Purchasing NFT card packs**
- **Unlocking premium content and customizations**

### Fiat-to-Crypto Onboarding

To make the game accessible to non-crypto users, we’re integrating fiat-to-crypto options directly within the game wallet. Gamers will be able to purchase **1000 tokens** using USDC, acquired through services like Ramp and Moonpay.

## Revenue Sharing Opportunities

- **Council of 1000 NFT Holders:** Holders of these ultra-rare NFTs will receive dividends from card pack sales.
- **Tournament Fees and Prizes:** Players who participate in tournaments and blitz campaigns will have opportunities to win real monetary prizes.

## Development Progress

We recently brainstormed and established a strategic framework balancing real-world development and forward-thinking creativity. This approach ensures forward momentum while continuously identifying future opportunities, creating flawless value and harmonic alignment between the moving parts of the 1000 ecosystem.

We’re designing scalable infrastructure to support both growth and innovation, integrating community feedback at every step. As we expand gameplay mechanics, custom card features, and real-time battle simulations, the project remains on track to deliver an exceptional player experience.

## What’s Next?

- **Beta Release:** A public testnet launch of the core token and initial gameplay mechanics is planned soon to gather feedback from early adopters.
- **Gameplay Refinement:** Ongoing updates to interactive mechanics and core game design principles, ensuring a balanced and engaging player experience.
- **AI Bot Expansion:** Enhancing the role of our AI bot to optimize player engagement and community interaction.
- **Exclusive Community Events:** Look forward to live AMAs, tournaments, and more opportunities to shape the game.
