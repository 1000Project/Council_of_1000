# The Cards of the Thousandfold Realm  
_The Fundamental Tools Through Which Champions Shape Reality_

Cards are the mechanical manifestation of metaphysical forces within the Thousandfold Realm.  
Where Champions express philosophy through conviction, cards express philosophy through action.

Every card represents a moment of power, a fragment of Realm-energy, an expression of identity, or a tactical decision that reshapes the state of play.

This document provides the public-facing explanation of the card system: card types, role, structure, and how they interact with the larger rules of the Council of 1000 TCG.

# 🜂 What a Card Represents

A card is not an object.  
It is a distilled expression of a Champion’s will.

Cards may represent:

- Units brought into being  
- Actions taken by the Champion  
- Relics of philosophical or historical significance  
- Manifestations of Realm-energy  
- Council decrees or Seat-based authority  

Each card serves as a tactical tool in the ongoing philosophical struggle of the Thousandfold Realm.

# 🜁 Card Types

There are five primary card types used in the game:

- **Champions** — the player’s identity and anchor  
- **Units** — manifestations of force, influence, or ideology  
- **Actions** — single events, decisions, or bursts of power  
- **Relics** — persistent effects, artifacts, philosophies, or constructs  
- **Seats** — metaphysical domains tied to the Council of 1000 (introduced sparingly)

Each type interacts with the game in unique ways, reinforcing the philosophical identity of the Realms.

# 🜃 Champions as the Core of the Deck

A deck begins with a single Champion.

Champions determine:

- Realm alignment  
- Ability kit  
- Passive and active effects  
- Influence progression  
- Available card pools  
- Playstyle identity  

Every card in the deck revolves around the Champion’s nature.  
They are the anchor of the player’s strategy and the metaphysical being through which the deck expresses itself.

---

# 🜄 Units

Units are extensions of a Champion’s will — followers, constructs, manifestations, or ideological avatars.

Units may represent:

- Dominion soldiers  
- Solace guardians  
- Veil agents  
- Genesis creations  
- Ruin abominations  
- Ascendance disciples  
- Paradox anomalies  

Units fight, defend, interact with lanes, and apply continuous pressure on the opponent.

---

# 🜅 Actions

Actions represent single bursts of activity, decisions, or shifts in reality.

They may depict:

- Tactical strikes  
- Defensive barriers  
- Manipulation of fate  
- Realm-specific metaphysical events  
- Philosophical breakthroughs  

Actions are instant, ephemeral, and powerful.  
They shape the tempo and direction of play.

---

# 🜆 Relics

Relics are long-lasting influences on the battlefield.

They may be:

- Ideological monuments  
- Ancient tools  
- Philosophical constructs  
- Living artifacts  
- Persistent enchantments of Realm-energy  

Relics reshape the field over time, enabling ongoing advantages or unique strategies.

---

# 🜇 Seats

Seats are metaphysical domains tied directly to the Council of 1000.

They are:

- ideological domains,  
- fragments of authority,  
- embodiments of a principle,  
- potential sources of political or metaphysical influence.

Seats are introduced sparingly due to their narrative weight and mechanical impact.  
They represent the deepest structures of power within the Thousandfold Realm.

# 🜂 Card Anatomy

Every card expresses several key components:

- **Name** — identity and flavor  
- **Realm** — philosophical alignment  
- **Rarity** — narrative weight  
- **Cost** — influence required to manifest the card  
- **Type Line** — Champion, Unit, Action, Relic, or Seat  
- **Rules Text** — gameplay instructions  
- **Traits & Keywords** — additional mechanical identity  
- **Flavor Text** (optional) — lore expression  
- **Art** — visual representation of the metaphysical form  

These elements combine to provide both gameplay clarity and narrative immersion.

# 🜁 Realm Identity in Cards

Each Realm has a mechanical and thematic identity expressed through its cards.

Dominion cards emphasize pressure and control.  
Solace cards emphasize protection and endurance.  
Veil cards emphasize manipulation and information.  
Genesis cards emphasize creation and growth.  
Ruin cards emphasize decay and inevitability.  
Ascendance cards emphasize mastery and refinement.  
Paradox cards emphasize unpredictability and distortion.

Realm identity ensures that every deck expresses a coherent philosophical playstyle.

---

# 🜃 Deck Construction

A deck is built around a Champion and consists of:

- A fixed number of cards  
- Cards aligned to the Champion’s Realm  
- Neutral or Realm-compatible cards (when allowed)  
- Unique cards if permitted by rarity rules  

Deck construction is where gameplay philosophy begins:  
the player chooses how their Champion’s worldview will express itself in tactical form.

---

# 🜄 How Cards Interact with Lanes

Lanes are the structured metaphysical battlefield.  
Units and Relics may occupy lanes, affecting combat and tactical positioning.

Actions may target specific lanes, multiple lanes, or bypass lanes entirely depending on Realm identity and card design.

The lane system adds spatial strategy to philosophical conflict.

---

# 🜅 Card Rarity and Narrative Weight

Rarity is not a measure of raw power. It signifies:

- narrative importance  
- metaphysical uniqueness  
- storytelling function  
- connection to canonical lore  

Common cards depict everyday expressions of Realm-energy.  
Mythic or Ascendant cards represent world-shaping forces or canonical figures tied directly to the Council.

---

# 🜆 Cards and the Narrative

Cards are also storytelling tools.

Each expansion introduces:

- new Units representing evolving factions  
- new Actions reflecting shifting political or Realm tensions  
- Relics tied to legendary moments or artifacts  
- occasional canonical Champions or Seats  

The card pool grows as the Thousandfold Realm evolves.

---

# 🜄 Summary

Cards are the tactical, narrative, and philosophical tools through which Champions express themselves.

They define:

- the strategy of the deck  
- the nature of combat  
- the evolution of the meta  
- the unfolding story of the Thousandfold Realm  

Every card is a fragment of belief made manifest, shaping the battlefield and the fate of the Council of 1000.
