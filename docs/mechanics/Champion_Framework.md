# Champion Framework  
_The Mechanical Design Rules for Champions_

Champions are the heart of Council of 1000 — the philosophical avatars that define deck identity, card access, win conditions, and strategic expression.

This document outlines the official framework for Champion cards, ensuring consistency across expansions and a clear connection between **gameplay**, **Realm identity**, and **core lore**.

# 🜂 What a Champion Is (Mechanically)

A Champion is:

- the **leader** of the deck  
- the **source of Realm identity**  
- the **primary engine** of strategy  
- a **persistent, un-removable presence**  
- the **anchor** of both flavor and gameplay  

Champions begin the game in play.  
They cannot be destroyed or removed — they can only lose **Resolve**, and when a Champion’s Resolve reaches zero, the player **loses the game**.

This ties gameplay directly to lore:  
**a Champion’s fall marks the end of their worldview.**

# 🜁 Champion Card Anatomy

Every Champion card includes the following:

### **1. Name**
Unique, thematic, and Realm-aligned.

### **2. Realm Binding**
Determines:

- deck-building restrictions  
- available card pools  
- synergy interactions  
- faction mechanics  

A Champion may belong to **exactly one Realm**.

### **3. Resolve**
A Champion’s lifepool.  
When Resolve hits **0**, the player loses.

Standard ranges:

- **25–35 Resolve** for player Champions  
- **20–30 Resolve** for aggressive Champions  
- **30–35 Resolve** for defensive Champions  

Legendary canonical Champions may break this range for thematic reasons.

### **4. Passive Ability**
Always active.  
Defines the Champion’s *identity*.

Examples:
- Dominion: “Whenever a Unit attacks, gain +1 temporary Attack this turn.”  
- Veil: “When you draw your second card each turn, trigger hidden effects.”  

### **5. Activated Abilities**
Influence-cost abilities the Champion may use once per turn or with special conditions.

Typically:
- **1 low-cost utility ability**  
- **1 higher-cost signature ability**  

### **6. Signature Ability**
A unique, powerful effect.  
Often limited by:
- once per turn  
- once per game  
- requiring a specific board state  
- requiring synergy triggers  

Signature abilities define high-skill expression.

# 🜃 Deck-Building Rules

A deck must follow the Champion’s Realm identity.

### **Deck Size**
- Standard: **40 cards**  
- Maximum duplicates: **3 copies** of any card  
- Seat Cards: **1 copy only**  

### **Realm Restriction**
A deck’s cards must match the Champion’s Realm, except:

- **Neutral cards**, available to all Realms  
- **Universal mechanics**, found in expansions  

Cross-Realm cards do *not* exist in core design, preserving faction identity.

### **Champion-Specific Cards**
Some cards are designed only for a named Champion.  
These appear rarely and only in expansions.

# 🜁 Champion Abilities & Influence

Champions cannot be played or removed, but their abilities define tempo.

### **Passive Abilities**
Active from turn zero.  
Used to:

- shape the deck’s strategy  
- alter Influence flow  
- change card interactions  
- encourage specific play patterns  

### **Activated Abilities**
Require Influence to use:

- Low cost: **1–2 Influence**  
- High cost: **3–6 Influence**  

Influence scaling ensures that powerful Champion abilities cannot be spammed early.

### **Signature Abilities**
Often game-defining and high-cost:

- **6+ Influence**  
- **once per game**  
- **conditional activations** (e.g., “only usable if you control 3 Units”)

---

# 🜄 Champion Resolve & Combat

Champions cannot attack or block directly.  
Their Resolve is affected by:

- unblocked Unit attacks  
- Action card effects  
- Ruin decay mechanics  
- certain Seat Card effects  

Champions interact *indirectly* with combat, reflecting their role as metaphysical anchors rather than battlefield fighters.

---

# 🜂 Champion Rarity Tiers

Champions exist in four rarity bands:

### **1. Player Champions (Rare)**  
Generic ascendants for deck-building variety.

### **2. Realm Exemplars (Epic)**  
Special Champions that represent archetypes unique to each Realm.

### **3. Canonical Champions (Legendary)**  
Named characters from the Master Bible.  
Limited to 1–3 per expansion.

### **4. Ascendant Champions (Mythic)**  
World-altering figures.  
Often tied to major expansions or Seat conflicts.

# 🜃 Champion Role in Expansions

Champions drive expansion identity.

Each expansion introduces:

- **2–4 new Champions per Realm**  
- **1–2 Legendary Canon Champions**  
- **1 Ascendant Champion** (major storyline figure)  
- **0–1 Seat Cards** tied to Champion arcs  

Champions determine:

- new keywords  
- new mechanics  
- Realm shifts  
- narrative direction  

They are the *face* of each set.

---

# 🜄 Champion Balance Philosophy

Champions must be:

- **strong**, but not oppressive  
- **thematically aligned**, but mechanically fair  
- **distinct**, but not confusing  

Design constraints include:

- Passives must not generate infinite loops  
- Activations must not allow turn-one or turn-two kills  
- Signatures must not bypass core gameplay entirely  
- Resolve must scale responsibly with cost/identity  
- Realm identity must never become mechanically interchangeable  

Champions are designed first, tested long, and supported across expansions.

# 🜁 Summary

Champions are the metaphysical and mechanical core of Council of 1000. They:

- define deck identity  
- bind Realms  
- shape gameplay strategies  
- provide persistent effects  
- embody the lore  
- scale with expansions  
- anchor competitive play  

A Champion is not merely a card —  
it is the philosophy the player brings to the battlefield.
