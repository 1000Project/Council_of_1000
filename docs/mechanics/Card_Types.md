# Card Types  
_The Core Components of Deck Construction and Gameplay_

Council of 1000 is a Champion-centric TCG built around five primary card types:

1. **Champion Cards**  
2. **Unit Cards**  
3. **Action Cards**  
4. **Relic Cards**  
5. **Seat Cards**

Each type reflects a different expression of the Thousandfold Realm’s metaphysics and contributes to the game’s identity through unique rules, roles, and design constraints.

# 🜂 1. Champion Cards  
_The identity of the deck. The heart of the Realm._

A **Champion** is the foundational card around which a deck is built.  
Your Champion determines:

- your **Realm alignment**  
- your **deck-building rules**  
- your **signature ability**  
- your **passive effect**  
- your **win condition options**  
- your **philosophical identity**  

### Champions Begin in Play  
Unlike other cards, the Champion starts the game already on the field — representing the metaphysical presence of the player’s worldview.

### Champion Abilities  
Each Champion includes:

- **1 Passive Ability** — always active, defining the playstyle  
- **1–2 Activated Abilities** — costing Influence  
- **1 Signature Ability** — often a once-per-turn or once-per-game effect  

### Champion Resolve  
Champions have a health-like value called **Resolve**.  
If a Champion’s Resolve reaches zero, the player loses the game.

### Canonical vs. Player Champions  
Canonical Champions appear as Legendary/Mythic cards.  
Most decks use “player Champions,” representing rising contenders — preserving lore while allowing gameplay flexibility.

# 🜁 2. Unit Cards  
_The Champion’s extensions, followers, creations, or manifestations._

Units represent the entities that fight on behalf of a Champion. They can be:

- warriors  
- constructs  
- beasts  
- specters  
- creations  
- philosophical embodiments  

Units have:

- **Attack**  
- **Health**  
- **Influence Cost**  
- **Realm Affinity**  
- **Keywords** (e.g., Guard, Strike, Evolve, Echo)

### Summoning & Presence  
Units enter the battlefield during the Main Phase.  
They act as the primary tools for combat, board control, and strategic expression.

### Realm Identity  
Units reflect their Realm:

- Dominion Units = high aggression  
- Solace Units = shields, healers, defenders  
- Veil Units = stealth, triggers, information manipulation  
- Genesis Units = creation, token engines, evolution  
- Ruin Units = decay, recursion, sacrifice  
- Ascendance Units = synergy loops, buffs  
- Paradox Units = unpredictable, probability-driven

# 🜃 3. Action Cards  
_Instant or sorcery-like effects powered by Influence and philosophy._

Actions represent the Champion’s ability to shape the battlefield directly.  
They are one-time effects that resolve immediately.

Common Action roles include:

- damage  
- healing  
- card draw  
- manipulation  
- summoning  
- debuffs  
- recursion  
- probability distortion  
- Realm-specific triggers  

### Timing  
Most Actions are played during the Main Phase, but some specify alternative phases such as Combat or End Phase.

### Realm Expression  
Actions are the clearest expression of each Realm’s theme:

- Dominion → force  
- Solace → protection  
- Veil → secrets  
- Genesis → creation  
- Ruin → entropy  
- Ascendance → precision  
- Paradox → chaos

# 🜄 4. Relic Cards  
_Persistent philosophical constructs that reshape the battlefield._

Relics are ongoing effects — artifacts, structures, doctrines, devices, enchantments.  
In the lore, these represent metaphysical anchors or creations tied to a Champion’s ideology.

Relics:

- remain in play permanently unless destroyed  
- can modify Units, Champions, or battlefield rules  
- often interact with Realm mechanics  
- may have durability or conditional persistence  

Examples:

- Dominion fortresses  
- Solace sanctums  
- Veil runes  
- Genesis engines  
- Ruin altars  
- Ascendance shrines  
- Paradox anomalies  

Relics allow decks to build engines, fortify positions, or reshape tempo.

# 🜅 5. Seat Cards  
_The rarest and most powerful cards in the game. The embodiment of Council authority._

Seat Cards represent the metaphysical Seats of the Council of 1000 — positions of immense influence and philosophical authority.

Seat Cards are:

- **Legendary or Mythic only**  
- **One-of-a-kind per expansion**  
- **Difficult to play**  
- **Game-altering**  
- **Often tied to specific Champion archetypes**  
- **High Influence cost or special conditions**  

A Seat Card may:

- rewrite battlefield rules  
- empower Champions drastically  
- alter Influence progression  
- serve as an alternate win condition  
- reflect political events in the Council  

Seats are the pinnacle of the game’s design space.

# 🜆 Additional Card Subtypes  
Future expansions introduce optional subtypes such as:

- **Evolved Units** (Ascendance upgrades)  
- **Decaybound Units** (Ruin interactions)  
- **Creation Nodes** (Genesis token engines)  
- **Veil Schemes** (hidden-trigger cards)  
- **Paradox Threads** (probability modifiers)  

These extend the design space without complicating the core five card types.
