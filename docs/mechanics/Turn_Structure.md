# Turn Structure  
_The Rhythm, Flow, and Timing of Play in Council of 1000_

Combat in the Thousandfold Realm is not chaos — it is the structured expression of philosophy.  
Each turn represents a Champion's attempt to assert their worldview over the battlefield.

The turn structure in Council of 1000 is intentionally **simple, clean, and strategic**, allowing Realm identity and card interactions to shine without overwhelming new players.

# 🜂 Overview of a Turn

A standard player turn has **five phases**:

1. **Draw Phase**  
2. **Influence Phase**  
3. **Main Phase**  
4. **Combat Phase**  
5. **End Phase**

Each phase has its own rules, timing windows, and opportunity for interaction.

---

# 1. Draw Phase  
_“Perception becomes possibility.”_

At the start of the turn, the active player:

- draws **1 card** from their deck  
- resolves any “start of turn” triggers  
- checks for turn-based effects (burning, decay, maintenance, etc.)

If the player must draw but cannot, they **lose the game** through deck exhaustion — a canonical alternate defeat condition.

### Timing Notes:
- No cards may be played during the Draw Phase.  
- Both players may have passive triggers.  
- Effects that modify draw count apply here.

---

# 2. Influence Phase  
_“Conviction fuels action.”_

The active player gains:

- **+1 Influence** (up to the cap of 10)

This is the foundation of the Influence System.

### Additional Influence may be gained through:
- Champion passives  
- Realm mechanics  
- Relics  
- Unit abilities  
- Expansion-specific keywords  

### Timing Notes:
- Influence cannot be spent in this phase.  
- Triggered abilities that occur “when you gain Influence” resolve here.

---

# 3. Main Phase  
_“A Champion shapes the battlefield.”_

This is the broadest and most interactive phase of the game.  
Here, the active player may:

- **Play Units**  
- **Cast Actions**  
- **Deploy Relics**  
- **Activate Champion abilities** (unless tied to other phases)  
- **Trigger Realm mechanics**  
- **Set up combos**  
- **Establish board presence**

The Main Phase is where a player expresses their Realm identity.

### Timing Notes:
- The opposing player may respond with cards that specify “during an opponent’s Main Phase.”  
- Relics enter play immediately unless otherwise specified.  
- Units enter play with summoning delay only if they have the keyword.

---

# 4. Combat Phase  
_“Philosophy meets force.”_

Combat is the test of ideological strength. This phase consists of three steps:

### **4A — Declare Attackers**  
The active player chooses which Units will attack.

### **4B — Declare Blockers**  
The defending player chooses which Units will block (if any).

### **4C — Resolve Combat**  
Combat damage is dealt simultaneously unless a card specifies otherwise.

Damage interacts with:

- Unit health  
- Champion health or Resolve  
- Relics with durability  
- Triggered abilities  
- Realm-specific effects (especially Dominion, Ruin, Paradox)

### Optional Step: Post-Combat Actions  
Some effects unlock only after combat resolves.

---

# 5. End Phase  
_“The Realm resets for another clash.”_

During this phase:

- “End of turn” triggers resolve  
- Temporary buffs or debuffs expire  
- Units with recovery steps begin resetting  
- Cards or effects set to fade do so here  

Once all effects resolve, the turn ends and priority passes to the opponent.

### Timing Notes:
- No non-triggered actions may be taken.  
- End Phase cannot be skipped.  
- If multiple triggers exist, the active player chooses resolution order.

---

# 🜂 Player Priority

Throughout the turn, **priority** alternates between the two players.  
A player may only perform actions when they have priority.

Priority is passed:

- after an action  
- after a trigger resolves  
- at the end of each sub-phase  
- before combat declaration  
- after combat resolution  
- before end-of-turn cleanup  

This system keeps interactions fair and strategic without overwhelming complexity.

# 🜁 Realm Influence on Turn Structure

Each Realm interacts with the turn differently:

### **Dominion**  
Thrives in Main Phase aggression; pushes tempo early.

### **Solace**  
Leverages End Phase to restore, cleanse, or shield.

### **Veil**  
Controls priority windows; thrives on reactions.

### **Genesis**  
Establishes value engines and creation loops during Main Phase.

### **Ruin**  
Triggers decay effects during Draw or End Phases.

### **Ascendance**  
Synergizes abilities across multiple phases for mastery combos.

### **Paradox**  
Alters timing rules and probability during Combat Phase.

These differences make Realms feel distinct without altering the universal turn structure.

# 🜃 Turn Structure Philosophy

The design principles behind this turn system:

- **Simplicity first** — new players can learn quickly.  
- **Strategic depth** — experienced players can master timing windows.  
- **Lore alignment** — phases map cleanly to metaphysical themes.  
- **Expandability** — future sets can introduce new triggers, keywords, or timing clauses without breaking the core.  
- **Competitive clarity** — all interactions are trackable and judge-friendly.

# 🜂 Summary

A turn in Council of 1000 is more than a sequence of steps — it is the staged expression of a Champion’s worldview.

The five-phase structure creates:

- predictable rhythm  
- strategic depth  
- clear timing  
- balanced gameplay  
- room for Realm-specific identity  
- strong competitive integrity  

Influence powers the turn.  
Champions define the strategy.  
Realms shape the expression.  
The Council determines the outcome.

This is the core engine upon which the entire game is built.
