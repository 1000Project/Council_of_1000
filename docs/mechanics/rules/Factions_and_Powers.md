# The Realms & Factions of the Thousandfold Realm  
_The Philosophical Forces That Shape Existence_

Realms and Factions are the great ideological powers of the Thousandfold Realm.  
They are not kingdoms, species, or nations — they are **metaphysical alignments**, each embodying a way of thinking so potent that it becomes a law of reality.

Every Champion belongs to one Realm.  
Every civilization, faction, school, guild, or cult draws power from these foundations.

This document explains what Realms and Factions are, how they function in the lore, and how they translate into gameplay mechanics.

# 🜂 What Is a Realm?

A **Realm** is a fundamental philosophical force.

A Realm is not physical territory — it is a worldview powerful enough to manifest as magic, law, destiny, or violence.  
Realms shape geography, destiny, culture, and even the minds of those who touch them.

A Realm defines:

- the nature of a Champion’s power  
- the beliefs of those who follow them  
- the metaphysical rules that govern its lands  
- the card pool and mechanics tied to that philosophy  

A Champion cannot change Realms.  
Realms are absolute truths of identity.
