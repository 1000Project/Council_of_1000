# Influence System  
_The Core Resource of the Thousandfold Realm_

Influence is the primary resource of the Council of 1000 TCG.  
It represents the **Champion’s ability to exert their philosophy** onto the battlefield.

Influence is not mana, energy, or currency —  
it is **ideological force**, the metaphysical pressure a Champion applies to shape reality in accordance with their Realm.

Every action taken in the game requires Influence.

# 🜂 What Influence Represents

In the lore, Influence is the measure of how strongly a Champion’s worldview asserts itself against opposing worldviews.  
Mechanically, it controls:

- **card play tempo**  
- **ability activation**  
- **power progression**  
- **Realm identity expression**  
- **match pacing**  
- **the skill curve**  

Influence ties gameplay directly to the philosophical nature of the Realms.

Dominion **imposes**.  
Solace **stabilizes**.  
Veil **manipulates**.  
Genesis **creates**.  
Ruin **erodes**.  
Ascendance **perfects**.  
Paradox **distorts**.

All through Influence.

# 🜁 Gaining Influence

Each turn, players automatically gain **1 Influence** during the Influence Phase.

This is the baseline flow of the game — clean, predictable progression that rewards planning.

Additional Influence can be gained from:

- Champion abilities  
- Realm mechanics  
- Relics  
- Units  
- Action cards  
- Seat-related effects (rare)  

No Realm gains Influence faster by default.  
This preserves balance at the core resource layer.

# 🜄 Influence Cap

The standard maximum Influence a player can hold is:

**10 Influence**

Expansions may introduce effects that:

- temporarily raise the cap  
- reduce an opponent’s cap  
- lock cap progression  
- overflow Influence into alternate resources  

But the base cap ensures:

- stable game pacing  
- clear turn progression  
- meaningful late-game decisions  

---

# 🜃 Spending Influence

Influence is spent to:

- play Units  
- activate Champion abilities  
- cast Actions  
- deploy Relics  
- use Realm-unique mechanics  
- trigger certain alternate win conditions  

Most cards have **Influence Costs** ranging from **0–7**, with late-game cards scaling to the cap.

Seat Cards (the rarest in the game) often require **high Influence** or special conditions instead of traditional costs.

# 🜁 Influence & Realms

Each Realm uses Influence in a way that reflects its philosophy:

### **Dominion**  
Influence is used to overwhelm opponents with early pressure.

### **Solace**  
Influence fuels protection, healing, and reactive stabilization.

### **Veil**  
Influence enables hidden information, counterplay, and manipulation.

### **Genesis**  
Influence drives creation loops, token generation, and resource “branching.”

### **Ruin**  
Influence accelerates decay, attrition, and self-sacrifice mechanics.

### **Ascendance**  
Influence refines, perfects, and empowers synergistic combos.

### **Paradox**  
Influence destabilizes probability, causing unpredictable outcomes.

---

# 🜂 Influence Curve & Game Pacing

Influence determines the **tempo curve** of the match:

- **Turns 1–3:** foundational play, board setup  
- **Turns 4–6:** Realm identity expression becomes clear  
- **Turns 7–9:** Champions begin activating signature abilities  
- **Turns 10+:** high-cost cards, Seat effects, alternate win conditions  

This pacing aligns with Ascension structures from the lore.

---

# 🜄 Influence Burn and Overflow

Some Realms interact with Influence in unique ways:

### **Genesis Overflow**
Excess Influence may convert into **Creation Tokens** (expansion mechanic).

### **Ruin Burn**
Cards may sacrifice Influence from either player to trigger entropy effects.

### **Paradox Surge**
Overflow Influence may trigger probability distortions.

These mechanics are **Realm-specific** and introduced through expansions, but the core Influence system remains stable.

---

# 🜁 Strategic Weight

Influence is designed to:

- reward planning  
- encourage Realm-unique strategies  
- scale cleanly across expansions  
- support both new and advanced players  
- tie gameplay to lore in a meaningful, thematic way  

Influence is the bridge between philosophy and mechanics.

# 🜂 Summary

Influence is the metaphysical resource that defines tempo, power, and strategy in the Council of 1000 TCG.  
It reflects the strength of a Champion’s worldview and governs how players shape the battlefield.

Key principles:

- Gain 1 Influence automatically each turn  
- Cap of 10 Influence  
- Spend Influence to play cards and activate abilities  
- Realm identity determines *how* Influence is used  
- Influence progression defines match pacing  

This system is the mechanical backbone of the game.
