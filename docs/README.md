# Council of 1000 – The Official Trading Card Game of The 1000 Project  
_A Competitive, Lore-Rich, Champion-Centric PvP TCG_

Council of 1000 is a **competitive NFT-supported PvP trading card game** set in the Thousandfold Realm — a fractured metaphysical world shaped by one thousand legendary Champions. Each Champion embodies a distinct philosophical force, giving rise to the Realms, factions, conflicts, and meta-struggles that define the game.

This repository contains the **public canon**, **design architecture**, **lore bible**, and **mechanical systems** for the Council of 1000 TCG.

## 🜂 Core Identity

Council of 1000 is built on three pillars:

### **1. The 1000 Champions**
One thousand mythic figures, each representing a powerful worldview or discipline.  
Champions shape deck strategy, faction identity, and progression.

### **2. The Council of Realms (Factions)**
The Thousandfold Realm is governed by competing ideological Realms.  
Each Realm has:
- A distinct philosophy  
- A unique mechanical identity  
- Specific Champion archetypes  
- Exclusive card pools  

*(See `/docs/lore/Realms.md`)*

### **3. Ascending Ranks**
Players rise through competitive tiers through:
- Skill  
- Mastery  
- Accomplishment  

This is a **merit-first system**, not tied to tokens, staking, or holdings.

## 🜁 Game Philosophy

Council of 1000 is:

- **Game-First** – Designed to be fun, deep, and strategically rich without requiring blockchain knowledge.
- **Champion-Centric** – Your Champion defines your deck’s mechanics, win conditions, and faction alignment.
- **Lore-Driven** – Every card, keyword, and expansion is anchored in the Thousandfold narrative.
- **NFT-Supported** – Ownership enhances the experience where useful (cards, packs, cosmetics), without intruding on gameplay.
- **Studio-Structured** – Built from day one as a multi-expansion, multi-year franchise.
