# How to Play  
_Your First Match in the Thousandfold Realm_

This document teaches new players how to set up a match, take turns, and execute basic interactions using their Champion and deck.

---

# 🜂 Match Setup

Each player performs the following:

- Select a **Champion**  
- Shuffle a **40‑card deck** aligned to that Champion’s Realm  
- Optionally reveal **Seat** if format allows  
- Draw **5 cards** as a starting hand  

Players may take **one free mulligan** by reshuffling their hand and drawing 5 new cards.

---

# 🜁 Starting the Game

A random method determines who goes first.

- The **first player** draws **0 cards** on turn one  
- The **second player** draws **1 card**  

Both players start with:

- **0 Influence**  
- **full Resolve** according to their Champion card  

---

# 1. Taking a Turn

A turn consists of these phases:

1. **Draw Phase** – draw a card  
2. **Influence Phase** – gain 1 Influence (up to 10)  
3. **Main Phase** – play Units, Actions, Relics  
4. **Combat Phase** – attack and defend  
5. **End Phase** – cleanup and end‑of‑turn triggers  

Turns alternate until a Champion reaches 0 Resolve.

# 2. Playing Cards

To play a card:

1. Announce the card  
2. Pay its Influence cost  
3. Place it onto the Stack  
4. Resolve when priority passes  

Units enter the field.  
Actions go to the Void after resolving.  
Relics remain until destroyed.

# 3. Attacking and Blocking

During Combat:

- Attacking units must be declared simultaneously  
- Defending player assigns blockers  
- Units deal damage equal to their Power  
- Damage taken persists unless healed  

If a Champion takes damage, their Resolve decreases.

---

# 4. Using Champion Abilities

Champions have:

- **Passive abilities** – always active  
- **Activated abilities** – cost Influence  
- **Signature abilities** – powerful once‑per‑game effects  

Champion abilities follow the same Stack rules as other effects.

---

# 5. Ending the Game

The game ends when:

- a Champion’s Resolve hits 0  
- a card’s alternate win/loss condition resolves  
- a player cannot draw  

Once the game ends, no further actions may occur.
