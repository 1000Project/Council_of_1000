# Rules Overview  
_The Core Rules of Council of 1000_

Council of 1000 is a competitive, champion‑driven tactical card game set within the Thousandfold Realm. Players choose a Champion, build a deck aligned with that Champion’s Realm, and battle using Influence, Units, Actions, and Relics while managing tactical timing windows and philosophical power identities.

Victory is achieved by reducing the opposing Champion’s **Resolve** to zero or meeting an alternate win condition granted by Seats, Relics, or Realm mechanics.

This document provides the full player‑facing explanation of game structure, states, sequencing, and rules.

# 🜂 Game Structure

A match is played between **two players**, each using:

- A **Champion**  
- A **40‑card deck** aligned to that Champion’s Realm  
- An optional **Seat** (if the format allows it)  

Games proceed through:

- turns  
- phases  
- actions  
- stack resolutions  

Everything is governed by deterministic rules defined in the Master Bible and Studio Design Bible.

# 🜁 Victory Conditions

A player wins when:

- the enemy Champion’s **Resolve** reaches 0  
- a card defines an alternate victory condition and its requirements are met  
- the opponent cannot legally draw a card  

A player loses when:

- their own Resolve reaches 0  
- an opponent’s alternate win condition resolves  
- they attempt to draw from an empty library  

A game may end in a draw only when a card or rule explicitly states it.

---

# 1. Deck Construction Rules

- Decks must contain **exactly 40 cards**.  
- All cards must match the Champion’s **Realm alignment**.  
- **Legendary** cards are limited to **one copy per deck**.  
- All other cards allow **up to three copies**.  
- Seat cards are **optional** and limited to formats that allow them.  

Decklists must be revealed to tournament officials but not opponents.

# 2. Zones of Play

Council of 1000 uses the following zones:

- **Library** – the player’s deck  
- **Hand** – drawn cards  
- **Field** – Units, Relics, and Seats in play  
- **Void** – destroyed or used cards  
- **Stack** – pending effects  
- **Exile** – removed‑from‑game cards  

All zones are open information except the hand and library.

---

# 3. Card Types

The primary card types are:

- **Units** – entities that fight, defend, and generate effects  
- **Actions** – single‑use effects played then sent to the Void  
- **Relics** – permanent objects modifying rules or stats  
- **Champions** – the player avatar with passive and activated abilities  
- **Seats** – global metaphysical authorities altering match structure  

Full definitions are in separate card‑type documents.

---

# 4. Costs and Influence

Influence is the core resource generated automatically each turn.

- Players gain **1 Influence per turn**, up to **10 max**.  
- Cards and abilities have **Influence costs**.  
- Some Realms have alternate resource interactions (Genesis growth, Ruin decay, etc.).  

If you cannot pay a cost, the action cannot be taken.

---

# 5. Keywords

Keywords standardize abilities across all Realms:

- **Strike** – deals damage first  
- **Decay** – Ruin‑based death attrition  
- **Evolve** – Genesis transformation mechanic  
- **Flux** – Paradox probability‑altering keyword  
- **Rally** – Dominion combat surge  
- **Veilbind** – Veil manipulation keyword  

The full glossary appears in the Keywords file.

---

# 6. Targeting Rules

To target something, it must be:

- a legal target as defined by the card  
- visible and interactable  
- not immune or protected  

If all targets become illegal before resolution, the effect fizzles.

---

# 7. Replacement and Prevention Effects

If two replacement effects would apply simultaneously:

- the **controlling player** chooses the order  
- after one applies, the other evaluates if it still applies  

Prevention effects negate damage or events before they occur.

---

# 8. Game State Priority

Players alternate priority to take actions.

Priority passes when:

- both players decline to act  
- a stack item resolves  
- a phase ends  

The active player always receives priority first.

---

# 9. Illegal Actions

If an illegal action is attempted:

- the action is canceled  
- no costs are paid  
- the game state rewinds to the last legal point  

Tournament play uses judge intervention.

---

# 10. End of Match

When the game ends:

- triggered abilities stop resolving  
- no further actions may be taken  
- alternate win/loss conditions freeze  

If Resolve hits 0 during an opponent’s turn, the game ends immediately.
