# Turn Structure  
_The Flow of a Player Turn_

A turn in Council of 1000 consists of five phases processed in strict order. Each phase allows specific actions, triggers, and timing windows.

---

# 🜂 Draw Phase

- Draw one card  
- If the library is empty, a **Deck Exhaustion** event occurs  
- Deck Exhaustion causes the player to lose Resolve each time they must draw but cannot  

---

# 🜁 Influence Phase

- Gain **1 Influence**, up to a maximum of 10  
- Realm mechanics may modify resource gain  
- Start‑of‑turn triggers resolve here  

Genesis “growth ticks” and Ruin “decay ticks” occur in this phase.

---

# 1. Main Phase

Players may:

- play Units  
- play Actions  
- deploy Relics  
- activate Champion abilities  
- activate unit abilities  
- challenge Seats (if format allows)  

Both players alternate priority before moving to combat.

# 2. Combat Phase

Combat proceeds through:

1. Declare Attackers  
2. Declare Blockers  
3. Combat Damage  
4. Death and Resolve checks  

Dominion “Rally,” Ruin “Decay,” and Strike‑based keywords may change timing.

---

# 3. End Phase

- Resolve end‑of‑turn triggers  
- Discard down to maximum hand size (if imposed by format)  
- Pass turn to opponent  

The turn ends when all triggers and stack items finish resolving.
