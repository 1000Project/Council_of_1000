# Mechanics Overview  
_The Core Systems That Shape Play in the Council of 1000 TCG_

The Thousandfold Realm is a world defined by philosophy, but the card game built upon it is defined by structure, clarity, and tactical depth.  
This document outlines the foundational gameplay mechanics that govern matches, define pacing, and express the ideological identity of each Realm.

These systems form the backbone of how Champions manifest power, how players make decisions, and how the metaphysical conflict of the Council becomes a battle of tactics and strategy.

# 🜂 The Flow of the Game

Matches are structured around the ideological clash between two Champions, each seeking to reduce the opponent’s Resolve to zero while asserting the dominance of their Realm.  
Game flow is driven by:

- Influence — the resource of willpower  
- Lanes — the metaphysical battlefield  
- Units — manifestations of Realm identity  
- Actions — bursts of decisive power  
- Relics — persistent ideology made tangible  
- Abilities — expressions of Champion philosophy  

Every turn represents one moment in the broader philosophical conflict.

# 🜁 Turn Structure

Each turn follows a consistent sequence that establishes rhythm and fairness:

1. **Start Phase**  
   - Resolve beginning-of-turn effects  
   - Cooldowns decrease  
   - Influence refreshes or increases depending on Champion rules

2. **Main Phase**  
   Players may:
   - Summon Units  
   - Deploy Relics  
   - Play Actions  
   - Activate Champion abilities  
   - Move Units (if rules permit)

3. **Combat Phase**  
   - Units attack across lanes  
   - Defenders block or retaliate  
   - Damage is dealt simultaneously or in order depending on keywords

4. **End Phase**  
   - Resolve end-of-turn triggers  
   - Expire temporary effects  
   - Check board state for Realm interactions or destabilization effects

This structure remains stable across all expansions.

# 🜃 Influence: The Resource of Will

Influence is the primary resource used to play cards and activate abilities.

- Each Champion begins with a set amount of Influence  
- Influence grows naturally over turns  
- Certain Realms accelerate, manipulate, or drain Influence  
- Influence represents the metaphysical force of conviction  

Most cards require Influence to manifest, meaning resource management is central to gameplay.

---

# 🜄 Resolve: The Measure of Endurance

Resolve is the Champion’s life total — the metaphysical durability of their worldview.  
When a Champion’s Resolve reaches zero, the match ends.

Resolve is influenced by:

- Combat damage  
- Certain Actions or abilities  
- Realm-specific effects (Solace restores, Ruin corrupts, Paradox destabilizes)

Resolve is the ultimate victory condition.

---

# 🜅 Lanes: The Battlefield of Philosophy

The battlefield is divided into lanes, representing parallel channels of metaphysical conflict.

- Units are placed into lanes  
- Combat occurs across lanes  
- Relics may occupy lanes or have global effects  
- Certain Realms manipulate lane structure or visibility  

Lanes add positional strategy, allowing decks to pressure specific points or defend weak positions.

The three-lane system mirrors the tri-fold structure of the Thousandfold Realm.

---

# 🜆 Summoning and Deployment

Units and Relics enter play during the Main Phase.

**Units** represent manifestations of philosophy: soldiers, constructs, anomalies, guardians.  
**Relics** represent persistent ideas, artifacts, or constructs of power.

Summoning rules include:

- Units enter the lane where they are played  
- Some Units have summon effects  
- Relics may anchor to lanes, Champions, or the global field  
- Higher-cost Units represent greater metaphysical strain  

Deployment choices shape tactical momentum.

---

# 🜇 Combat and Conflict

Combat is lane-based and simultaneous unless modified by keywords.

Core combat rules:

- Attacking Units strike the opposing lane  
- If no defender exists, damage hits the Champion  
- Defenders deal their damage back  
- Certain Realms alter combat flow (Dominion accelerates, Veil redirects, Paradox disrupts)

The combat phase is the heart of board interaction.

---

# 🜈 Keywords and Abilities

Keywords provide consistent, reusable functionality across units.

Examples include:

- **Shield** — absorb one instance of damage  
- **Pierce** — overflow lane damage to Champion  
- **Hasten** — act earlier in combat  
- **Wither** — reduce health permanently  

Abilities appear on Units, Relics, and Champions, enabling deeper expression of Realm identity.

---

# 🜉 Actions: Momentary Expressions of Power

Actions are single-use effects that modify the battlefield, influence resources, manipulate lanes, or alter tempo.

Actions:

- do not occupy lanes  
- resolve immediately  
- often reflect the most dramatic metaphysical events  

Actions embody decisive intent.

---

# 🜊 Relics: Persistent Ideology

Relics remain on the battlefield until destroyed, banished, or overwritten.

They represent:

- philosophies made manifest  
- artifacts of profound significance  
- constructs of Realm energy  
- tools that alter the flow of battle  

Relics define long-term strategy and board development.

---

# 🜋 Champion Abilities

Each Champion has:

- A passive ability  
- One or more active abilities  
- Potentially an ultimate ability  

Abilities reflect the Champion’s worldview, creating unique playstyles and strategic identity.

Champion abilities may:

- Modify Influence  
- Alter lane states  
- Affect cards in hand  
- Change combat outcomes  
- Create or destroy Units  
- Trigger Realm-specific mechanics  

The Champion is the anchor of the deck.

---

# 🜌 Deck Construction

Decks are built around a single Champion and must adhere to:

- Realm alignment  
- Card pool restrictions  
- Unique limits  
- Set legality (in competitive formats)  
- Card count requirements  

The Champion determines the deck’s personality and tactical identity.

---

# 🜍 Victory Conditions

The primary victory condition is simple:

**Reduce the opponent’s Resolve to zero.**

Secondary or alternate win conditions may appear in future expansions, but Resolve remains the central axis of play.

---

# 🜎 Realm Influence on Mechanics

Each Realm shapes gameplay differently:

- **Dominion** — aggression, pressure, systems of force  
- **Solace** — protection, counters, sustain  
- **Veil** — secrecy, knowledge, misdirection  
- **Genesis** — creation, tokens, growth  
- **Ruin** — decay, entropy, resource corrosion  
- **Ascendance** — refinement, mastery, synergy  
- **Paradox** — probability warping, volatility  

Realm identity ensures that gameplay expresses philosophy.
