# World Overview  
_The Thousandfold Realm & The Rise of the Council of 1000_

The world of **The Thousandfold Realm** is not a traditional plane. It is an ever-shifting metaphysical continuum born from conflict, philosophy, and the wills of those powerful enough to shape reality itself.  
Here, thought is substance. Belief is law. Power is identity.

This is the origin point of the **Council of 1000** — an assembly of legendary Champions whose philosophies define the Realms and whose conflicts determine the fate of existence.

# 🜂 The Thousandfold Realm

The Thousandfold Realm is a world shaped not by geography, but by **ideology**.  
It is divided along metaphysical, philosophical lines known as **Realms** — vast domains formed by the dominant worldview of the Champions who ascended within them.

Where in ordinary worlds, borders are drawn on land, here they are drawn in **thought**.

The Realm changes based on:

- who holds power  
- what beliefs ascend  
- which Champions rise or fall  
- the shifting balance between creation, decay, knowledge, order, and chaos  

The Realm is alive.  
It remembers.  
It reacts.

Because of this, the Thousandfold Realm is both **ancient** and **constantly new**, endlessly reshaping itself around the will of the powerful.

# 🜁 The Shaping

The defining historical event of the Realm is known simply as **The Shaping**.

It was not a war, not a ritual, not even a moment — but a **transition** where metaphysical ideas coalesced into physical form. During the Shaping:

- Pure philosophies manifested into the Seven Realms  
- Champions awakened with powers tied to these philosophies  
- Reality reorganized itself around belief, will, and conviction  
- The Realm adopted its “Thousandfold” form, a lattice of layered realities and ideological territories  

After the Shaping, the world became a place where:

- Champions could alter matter through conviction  
- Realms could expand or shrink based on dominance  
- Conflicts of ideology became literal conflicts of power  

The Shaping forged the **cosmic rules** that now govern all play.

# 🜄 The Emergence of the Champions

From within each Realm rose individuals whose mastery of their philosophy transcended ordinary limits. These figures:

- bent the Realm to their will  
- influenced the structure of reality  
- gathered followers  
- shaped civilizations and narratives  
- became living archetypes of their philosophy  

They came to be known as **Champions**.

A Champion is not defined by birth, race, or class.  
A Champion is defined by **belief powerful enough to reshape reality**.

Over generations and cycles, **one thousand** such beings rose to prominence — each representing a philosophical discipline or interpretation of their Realm’s identity.

These one thousand became the pillars of the world’s structure.

# 🜂 Formation of the Council of 1000

As the power of Champions grew, their conflicts grew with them.  
Without order, the Thousandfold Realm risked collapsing back into formless chaos.

Thus emerged the **Council of 1000** — an accord among the greatest Champions, establishing:

- boundaries between Realms  
- laws governing metaphysical conflict  
- rituals of challenge and ascension  
- recognition of seats of power  
- mechanisms for resolving ideological warfare without destroying the world  

The Council is not a government.  
It is not a peacekeeping force.  
It is an **agreement** — the only thing preventing the Realms from consuming one another completely.

Every Champion occupies (or seeks) a **Seat**, representing their philosophical stance within the Council. Seats confer:

- prestige  
- influence  
- metaphysical authority  
- the ability to shape policy or reality within the Council’s domain  

But Seats can be challenged, conquered, stolen, or overturned through:

- duels  
- Realm conflicts  
- political maneuvering  
- ascension trials  

Thus the Council itself is a living battleground.

# 🜃 The Realms (High-Level)

The Thousandfold Realm is divided into **seven ideological Realms**, each shaped by a dominant worldview and the Champions who embody it.

- **Realm of Dominion** — strength, will, conquest  
- **Realm of Solace** — protection, restoration, harmony  
- **Realm of the Veil** — secrets, deception, hidden truth  
- **Realm of Genesis** — creation, innovation, life  
- **Realm of Ruin** — entropy, decay, inevitability  
- **Realm of Ascendance** — mastery, discipline, enlightenment  
- **Realm of Paradox** — chaos, probability, unstable truths  

Each Realm influences:

- Champion abilities  
- Deck construction  
- Faction identity  
- Expansion themes  
- Political dynamics in the Council  

See `/docs/lore/Realms.md` for full details.

# 🜁 The Seat Wars & Power Struggle

The Council is eternally unstable.

Champions rise and fall.  
Realms expand and contract.  
Seats shift in allegiance or are seized outright.

Whenever the balance tips too far:

- new Champions ascend  
- old Champions fall  
- Realms erupt into conflict  
- metaphysical laws are revised  
- the Council is forced to renegotiate the boundaries of existence  

These cycles are the narrative engine behind expansions.

# 🜄 The World in the Era of the TCG
