# World Overview  
_The Thousandfold Realm and the Structure of Its Existence_

The Thousandfold Realm is a metaphysical world shaped not by geography or physical law, but by belief, philosophy, and the will of those powerful enough to influence reality. Its boundaries shift, its landscapes reflect ideology, and its history is defined by the rise and fall of the 1000 Champions whose convictions reshape existence.

This document provides a foundational understanding of the world in which the Council of 1000 operates, the Realms that compose it, and the forces that shape its evolution.

# 🜂 Nature of the Thousandfold Realm

The Thousandfold Realm is a layered, multifaceted plane of existence where thought and reality intertwine. Physical geography exists, but it is subordinate to metaphysical truth.

Reality is influenced by:

- belief  
- ideology  
- philosophical resonance  
- the actions of Champions  
- the balance between the Seven Realms  

The world is not static. It shifts, collapses, reforms, and evolves as the influence of its Champions rises and falls.

# 🜁 The Seven Great Realms

The Thousandfold Realm is divided into seven ideological territories known as the Realms. These Realms are not nations or continents, but expressions of philosophy made tangible.

The Seven Realms are:

- **Dominion** — strength, order, conquest  
- **Solace** — preservation, harmony, protection  
- **Veil** — secrecy, strategy, unseen influence  
- **Genesis** — creation, invention, life  
- **Ruin** — decay, entropy, inevitability  
- **Ascendance** — mastery, refinement, transcendence  
- **Paradox** — instability, probability, contradiction  

Each Realm has:

- its own metaphysical laws  
- its own terrain shaped by ideology  
- its own political and philosophical movements  
- Champions who embody its truth  

The Realms coexist but constantly contend for influence.

# 🜃 Geography Shaped by Philosophy

The landscapes of the Thousandfold Realm reflect the collective convictions of its inhabitants.

Examples include:

- Dominion’s iron bastions and militaristic spires  
- Solace’s crystalline sanctuaries and protected groves  
- Veil’s labyrinthine libraries and shifting shadow-cities  
- Genesis’s living forests, constructs, and arcane machinery  
- Ruin’s decaying wastelands and collapsing citadels  
- Ascendance’s elevated monastic strongholds and disciplined arenas  
- Paradox’s impossible geometries, floating shards, and looping horizons  

These are not fixed regions. Their boundaries expand or contract as the influence of their Champions waxes or wanes.

# 🜄 The Convergence Threshold

At the center of the Thousandfold Realm lies the Convergence Threshold — the metaphysical crossroads where the Seven Realms overlap.

The Threshold is:

- the meeting place of all ideological forces  
- the seat of the Council of 1000  
- a neutral yet volatile territory  
- a battleground of influence  

The Threshold exists simultaneously as:

- a physical structure  
- a conceptual meeting of philosophies  
- a nexus where shifts in power manifest immediately  

It is the heart of political and metaphysical conflict.

# 🜅 The Council’s Influence on the World

The Council of 1000 does more than govern — it stabilizes the fabric of reality.

Council decisions can:

- expand or contract Realm borders  
- alter metaphysical laws  
- shift the balance of power  
- cause planar events or fissures  
- change how Champions manifest influence  

When the Council is unified, the Thousandfold Realm becomes stable.  
When the Council is fractured, the world enters periods of upheaval.

---

# 🜆 Ages and Cycles

The world progresses through Ages — large-scale epochs characterized by major philosophical shifts.

An Age ends when:

- a significant number of Seats fall  
- a Realm gains overwhelming influence  
- a metaphysical catastrophe reshapes reality  
- a new class of Champions ascends  
- Paradox destabilizes the structure of existence  

Each new Age changes the landscape, politics, and power dynamics of the entire Realm.

---

# 🜇 Factions and Cultures

Within each Realm, numerous factions exist:

- military orders  
- monastic schools  
- research guilds  
- shadow networks  
- creation enclaves  
- ruin cults  
- paradox cabals  

These groups influence the rise of Champions and shape the stories of expansions.

# 🜈 Magic, Technology, and Metaphysics

The Thousandfold Realm does not separate magic from science.  
Both are expressions of philosophical understanding.

- Genesis blends arcane invention with bio-engineering  
- Veil uses metaphysical information systems  
- Ascendance refines the body and mind into disciplined perfection  
- Dominion wields structured force and martial doctrine  
- Paradox manipulates probability and temporal distortion  

Each Realm develops its own approach to power.

---

# 🜉 Historical Tensions

The Thousandfold Realm has been shaped by countless conflicts:

- Dominion’s campaigns for order  
- Veil’s silent interventions  
- Solace’s attempts to preserve peace  
- Genesis’s expansion of life and creation  
- Ruin’s periodic collapses  
- Ascendance’s philosophical revolutions  
- Paradox’s destabilizing events  

These tensions form the backbone of the game’s story arcs.

# 🜊 The Role of Champions

Champions are the central figures of the Thousandfold Realm’s history.  
Their ascent marks shifts in power and philosophy.

Champions:

- define the boundaries of Realms  
- challenge or stabilize Council Seats  
- trigger major events  
- shape the political landscape  
- influence the world’s metaphysical structure  

The 1000 Champions collectively determine the fate of the Realm.

# 🜋 The Player’s Place in the World

Players take on the role of a Champion — canonical or emerging — whose decisions shape:

- combat  
- strategy  
- ideological expression  
- influence within the Council  

The game expresses the philosophical struggle of the Thousandfold Realm through tactical, competitive play.
