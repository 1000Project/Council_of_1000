# Gameflow  
_The Player Journey From Menu to Match to Post-Game_

Gameflow defines **how players experience Council of 1000 as a complete loop** — from entering the game, choosing a Champion, building decks, playing matches, and receiving rewards.

This document describes the canonical gameflow for both physical and digital versions of the TCG.

# 🜂 Overview of the Player Journey

Every session follows a simple but powerful loop:

1. **Enter the Game / Main Menu**  
2. **Choose a Champion or Deck**  
3. **Queue for a Match**  
4. **Play Through the Match (Turn Structure)**  
5. **Match Resolution (Victory / Defeat)**  
6. **Post-Game Rewards & Progression**  
7. **Return to Main Menu or Continue**

This loop supports:

- casual play  
- ranked competitive modes  
- narrative campaign content  
- tournaments  
- sealed/draft modes  

---

# 1. Main Menu  
_“Your path begins with a decision of philosophy.”_

Main menu options typically include:

- **Play** (core modes)  
- **Deck Builder**  
- **Champions** (progression + cosmetics)  
- **Collection**  
- **Shop / Packs**  
- **Lore Codex**  
- **Settings**  

Realm-specific visual theming reinforces identity.

---

# 2. Champion Select  
_“Choose the worldview through which you will shape the battlefield.”_

Before entering a match, the player selects:

- A **Champion**  
- A **Deck** built under that Champion’s Realm rules  

Champion Select screen displays:

- Realm identity  
- Champion Resolve  
- Passive ability  
- Activated abilities  
- Signature ability  
- Difficulty rating (Beginner → Expert)  
- Themed animations & sound cues  

This reinforces Champions as **philosophical avatars**, not just leaders.

---

# 3. Match Queue  
_“Two worldviews prepare to collide.”_

Players may choose from:

- **Casual Play**  
- **Ranked Mode**  
- **Draft / Sealed**  
- **Campaign Missions**  
- **Custom Matches / Friend Battles**

Queueing uses skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) when available.

During queue:

- Realm banners animate  
- A random Champion quote appears  
- Tooltips rotate showing tips for mechanics  

---

# 4. Match Start  
_“Reality bends to the stronger conviction.”_

Once matched:

1. **Opening Cinematic (short, skippable)**  
   Two Champions manifest on opposing sides.

2. **Initial Draw**  
   - 5-card opening hand  
   - Optional mulligan: discard any number → draw replacements → shuffle discards back into deck  

3. **Champion Resolve Displayed**  
   Both Champions’ Resolve values appear.

4. **First Player Determination**  
   Decided by:
   - coin flip (digital)  
   - die roll (physical)  

From here, the match transitions into the **Turn Structure**.

---

# 5. Match Flow  
_“Turn by turn, the Realms collide.”_

Gameplay follows the standard five-phase turn structure:

1. Draw Phase  
2. Influence Phase  
3. Main Phase  
4. Combat Phase  
5. End Phase  

During the match:

- Realms express identity through their mechanics  
- Influence progression dictates tempo  
- Champions activate abilities strategically  
- Units battle  
- Relics reshape the battlefield  
- Actions shift momentum  
- Seat Cards bring world-altering effects  

Everything serves the philosophy of the chosen Realm.

---

# 6. Victory & Defeat  
_“A worldview endures. Another fractures.”_

A match ends when:

### **Victory**
- Opponent’s Champion Resolve reaches **0**  
- Opponent cannot draw a card (deck exhaustion)  
- A Champion’s **alternate win condition** is fulfilled  
- A Seat Card triggers its victory clause  

### **Defeat**
- Your Champion Resolve reaches **0**  
- You cannot draw a required card  
- Opponent fulfills their alternate win condition  

Cinematic end screens reinforce Realm identity and narrative tone.

# 7. Post-Game Rewards  
_“Ascendance is earned, not given.”_

After each match, players receive:

- **Experience** (Champion level / player level)  
- **Cosmetic unlock progress**  
- **Daily/weekly quest progress**  
- **Currency or pack fragments**  
- **Season rewards (ranked mode)**  

Champion progression might unlock:

- alternate skins  
- new animations  
- Realm-specific auras  
- banners  
- visual effects  

Post-game also provides match analysis tools (digital version):

- damage graphs  
- Influence curves  
- card play history  
- misplay suggestions  

---

# 8. Return to Menu  
_“Another battle awaits.”_

Players return to the main menu with highlighted options:

- “Play Again”  
- “Modify Deck”  
- “View Stats”  
- “Open Packs”  

This maintains engagement and encourages continued progression.

# 🜂 UX Rules for Seamless Gameflow

To ensure a polished player experience:

- No more than **two loading screens** per match  
- Always provide clear timing windows  
- Visual cues must reflect Realm identity  
- Champion abilities must feel distinct but intuitive  
- Victory/defeat screens must reinforce narrative weight  
- Card resolution animations must never obscure game state  
- All menus must support controller, mouse, and mobile UI  

These constraints keep the game **accessible, modern, and immersive**.
