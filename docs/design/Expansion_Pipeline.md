# Expansion Pipeline  
_The Multi-Year Content Framework for Council of 1000_

Council of 1000 is built as a multi-year franchise with seasonal expansions, evolving mechanics, rotating Champion rosters, and shifting power structures within the Council.  

This document outlines the official expansion pipeline — the structure, cadence, and design principles guiding future sets.

# 🜂 Expansion Philosophy

Expansions must:

1. **Advance the narrative** of the Thousandfold Realm  
2. **Deepen the identity** of each Realm  
3. **Introduce new Champions** with unique strategic roles  
4. **Evolve mechanics** without power creep  
5. **Expand the Council’s political conflicts**  
6. **Support long-term competitive play**  
7. **Anchor new players** without overwhelming them  

Every expansion is an opportunity to explore ideological conflict and metaphysical evolution.

# 🜁 Annual Cadence

Each year consists of **three primary expansions** and **one mini-set**:

1. **Core Set / Block Starter** (Q1)  
   - Introduces the year’s narrative arc  
   - Establishes major mechanics  
   - Provides baseline Champions for each Realm  

2. **Mid-Year Expansion** (Q2/Q3)  
   - Evolves the conflict  
   - Adds new mechanics or keywords  
   - Introduces 1–2 Canonical Champions  

3. **Late-Year Expansion** (Q4)  
   - Climaxes the story arc  
   - Introduces Seat Cards  
   - Expands high-level competitive tools  

4. **Mini-Set / Interlude** (Between Q3–Q4)  
   - Focused on flavor, micro-mechanics, or specific Realms  
   - Excellent for introducing alt-art or special edition cards

# 🜃 Expansion Structure

Each full expansion contains:

- **1–2 Legendary Canon Champions**

# 🜆 New Mechanics Introduction Rules

New mechanics must follow these guidelines:

1. **Must reinforce a Realm’s identity**  
2. **Must be learnable within two games**  
3. **Must scale across at least two expansions**  
4. **Must not invalidate previous cards**  
5. **Must not introduce randomness without purpose**  
6. **Must support both casual and competitive play**  

Example:  
Paradox’s “Flux” keyword is introduced in Set 3, then refined in future expansions.

# 🜇 Champion Introduction Pipeline

Each set introduces:

- **2 new Champions per Realm** (14 total)  
- **2 Realm Exemplars** (Epic tier)
